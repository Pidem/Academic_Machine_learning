# Personal_Projects

In this repository, I have uploaded the code of various projects I work on in my spare time.

For each project, I uploaded a project description in the wiki

So far:

1. The Johnsson Lindenstrauss Transform (Testing the Efficiency of the structured pipeline)
2. Clustering Algorithms. Kmeans and Kmeans++ - efficiency comparison
